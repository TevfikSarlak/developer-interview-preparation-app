        question: "What are the advantages of using React?",
        answer:
          "React provides a number of advantages, such as: \n 1. It facilitates the creation of reusable UI components. \n 2. It offers a virtual DOM which enables efficient updates and rendering. \n 3. It ensures faster development and testing processes. \n 4. It enables developers to write code in JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript which allows for the creation of HTML-like structures in code. \n 5. It provides a strong community and a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries."

        id: 4,
        question: "What is a Virtual DOM?",
        answer:
          "The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM in the memory. React creates a Virtual DOM tree for every component in the application and updates it based on the changes in the component. Once the Virtual DOM has been updated, React calculates the difference between the new Virtual DOM tree and the previous one, and then updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM."

      {
        id: 5,
        question: "What are Props in React?",
        answer:
          "Props (short for 'Properties') are inputs to React components that allow the passing of data from parent components to child components. They are immutable and are passed down from the parent component to the child component via function parameters."
      },
      {
        id: 6,
        question: "What is State in React?",
        answer:
          "State is an object that holds information about the components current state. It can be updated using the setState() method. When the state object changes, React re-renders the component and its children."
      },
      {
        id: 7,
        question: "What is the difference between Props and State?",
        answer:
          "Props and State are both plain JavaScript objects used to store data in React components. However, there are some differences between them: \n 1. Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component while State can be modified by the child component using setState(). \n 2. Props are passed to the child component by the parent component while State is managed within the component itself. \n 3. Props are used to pass data from parent to child components while State is used to store data within a component."

        id: 8,
        question: "What is the difference between a Presentational component and a Container component?",
        answer:
          "Presentational components (also known as 'dumb' components) are concerned with how things look, whereas Container components (also known as 'smart' components) are concerned with how things work. Presentational components are often stateless and receive data via props, while Container components can maintain their own state and handle data manipulation logic."

        id: 9,
        question: 'What is the significance of keys in React?',
        answer: 'Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed from a list of elements. Keys should be given to elements inside an array to give the elements a stable identity. When a key is assigned to an element, React keeps track of it and knows that the element with that key is the same one that was previously rendered, allowing React to update the element instead of creating a new one.'

      {
        id: 10,
        question: 'What is JSX?',
        answer: 'JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension of JavaScript and is used to describe what the UI of a React application should look like. JSX is a syntax that is transformed into regular JavaScript at runtime.'
      },
      {
        id: 11,
        question: 'What is a state in React?',
        answer: 'A state in React is a JavaScript object that stores a component\'s dynamic data and determines the component\'s behavior and rendering. When the state of a component changes, the component will be re-rendered.'
      },
      {
        id: 12,
        question: 'What is a prop in React?',
        answer: 'A prop is short for "property" and is a way to pass data from one component to another in React. A prop is an input to a component and is immutable. A component should never modify its own props, but it can pass them down to its children components.'
      },
      {
        id: 13,
        question: 'What is the difference between state and props?',
        answer: 'State is managed within a component and is used to store a component\'s dynamic data. Props are inputs to a component that are passed in from a parent component. Props are immutable and should not be changed by the component. The state of a component can be changed, while the props cannot.'

      {
        id: 14,
        question: 'What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?',
        answer: 'In a controlled component, the value of the form element is controlled by the component\'s state. When the state changes, the value of the form element is updated accordingly. In an uncontrolled component, the form element\'s value is handled by the DOM itself. The component does not have direct control over the value of the form element.'

        question: 'What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC)?',
        answer: 'A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with extended functionality. HOCs are a common pattern in React used for code reuse, logic abstraction, and creating higher-level components.'
      },
      {
        id: 16,
        question: 'What is the virtual DOM in React?',
        answer: 'The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that React keeps in memory. React uses the virtual DOM to minimize the number of direct manipulations to the actual DOM, which can be expensive and slow. When the state of a component changes, React creates a new virtual DOM tree, compares it to the previous virtual DOM tree, and updates only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed.'
      },
      {
        id: 17,
        question: "What is a PureComponent in React?",
        answer: "A PureComponent is a type of React component that extends PureComponent instead of Component, and it provides a performance boost to your application. PureComponent performs a shallow comparison of state and props, and only re-renders when there is a difference. This means that if your state or props do not change, the component will not re-render, resulting in improved performance."
      },
      {
        id: 18,
        question: "What are controlled components in React?",
        answer: "Controlled components are input components in React that get their value from the state, and they only change when the state changes. This is in contrast to uncontrolled components, which manage their own state. Controlled components provide a way to ensure that the state and the UI are always in sync, and they are particularly useful when working with forms."
      },
      {
        id: 19,
        question: "What is the significance of keys in React?",
        answer: "Keys are used to give a unique identity to each element in an array, and they help React keep track of which items have changed, been added, or been removed. When React updates a component, it compares the new component tree to the previous one, and by using keys, React can determine which elements have been modified, and only update those elements, rather than re-rendering the entire list."
      },
      {
        id: 20,
        question: "What is React context?",
        answer: "React context is a feature that allows data to be passed down the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. It is particularly useful when dealing with data that needs to be accessed by many components at different levels of the tree. React context consists of a Provider component that provides the data, and a Consumer component that consumes the data."
      },
      {
        id: 21,
        question: "What is the significance of ref in React?",
        answer: "The ref attribute in React is used to get a reference to an element in the component. This is useful when you need to access the properties or methods of the underlying DOM element, such as when you need to focus an input field, or when you need to measure the size or position of an element. Refs can be created using the createRef() method, or by using a callback function."
      },
      {
        id: 22,
        question: "What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs) in React?",
        answer: "Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are functions that take a component and return a new component with enhanced functionality. HOCs are used to abstract common functionality into a reusable component, and they are particularly useful when you have several components that share the same logic. HOCs are a form of composition, and they allow you to create complex components from simple ones."

        question: "What is Redux?",
        answer: "Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, and it is commonly used with React. Redux provides a centralized store that holds the application state, and it allows changes to the state to be made using actions. Redux is particularly useful when dealing with complex applications with large amounts of data, and it provides a way to manage the state of your application in a predictable and scalable way."

        question:
        "What is the difference between props and state in React?",
        answer:
        "Both props and state are used to pass data from one component to another, but there are some differences between the two. Props are read-only and are passed from parent to child components, whereas state is used to manage a component's internal state and can be modified by the component itself. Additionally, changing props from within a component will not have any effect, but changing state will re-render the component and its children.",

        },
        {
        id: 27,
        question: "What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React?",
        answer:
        "Controlled components are components that derive their values from React's state and can only be changed via user input that triggers a change to the state. Uncontrolled components, on the other hand, store their own state internally and are updated by user input directly. Controlled components are typically preferred as they provide a more predictable user experience and can be more easily integrated with other React features like debugging tools.",

        id: 28,
        question:
        "What is the purpose of the shouldComponentUpdate() method in React?",
        answer:
        "The shouldComponentUpdate() method is a lifecycle method that allows a component to decide if it should re-render or not. By default, React will re-render a component whenever its state or props change, but this can be a costly operation in terms of performance. By implementing the shouldComponentUpdate() method, a component can perform a shallow comparison of its current props and state to the next props and state, and return false to skip the re-render if nothing has changed. This can greatly improve performance, especially for large or complex components.",

        id: 29,
        question:
        "What is the difference between a stateful component and a stateless component?",
        answer:
        "A stateful component is a component that manages its own state using the setState() method. Stateful components are usually class components. A stateless component, on the other hand, is a component that does not manage its own state and instead receives all its data from props passed down from a parent component. Stateless components are usually function components.",

        id: 30,
        question:
        "What is the purpose of the componentDidMount() method in React?",
        answer:
        "The componentDidMount() method is a lifecycle method that gets called after a component is mounted to the DOM. It is commonly used for tasks like fetching data from a server or initializing third-party libraries. The componentDidMount() method is only called once during the lifecycle of a component, and is a good place to perform any setup that requires access to the DOM.",

            question: "What is React Fiber?",
            answer: "React Fiber is a reimplementation of the React core algorithm, with a new algorithm and data structures designed to achieve incremental rendering of the components. It is a set of algorithms for efficiently updating the user interface (UI) of applications in response to user events or network requests. React Fiber can pause, abort, or restart work as per the priority set, which helps to create smooth and interruptible user interfaces."

            question: "What is the significance of Virtual DOM in React?",
            answer: "The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an abstraction of the HTML DOM. It is lightweight and detached from the browser-specific implementation details, making it fast and efficient. In React, the Virtual DOM is used as an optimization technique to reduce the number of costly DOM operations required to update the UI. React creates a Virtual DOM tree in memory, performs updates on it, and then calculates the minimal number of changes required to update the real DOM."

            question: "What is React Router?",
            answer: "React Router is a routing library for React that allows you to manage the navigation and URLs of your web application. It provides a declarative way to map URLs to components, allowing you to define dynamic routes, nested routes, and route parameters. React Router keeps your UI in sync with the URL, making it easy to handle browser history, handle nested routes, and conditionally render components."

            answer: "Keys are a special attribute used in React to give a unique identity to each element or component. They are used to help React identify which items have changed, added, or removed in a list. When a key is added to a list element or component, React can efficiently update the UI by only re-rendering the changed items, improving performance and reducing unnecessary DOM manipulations. Keys should be unique across siblings but not globally."

            question: "What is Redux?",
            answer: "Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. Redux stores the state of your application in a single object called the store, which cannot be directly modified. The only way to change the state is by dispatching actions, which are plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened."

When a list of elements is rendered, each element must have a unique key property. This enables React to uniquely identify each element and update only the specific elements that have changed, instead of re-rendering the entire list. Keys should be stable, predictable, and unique among their siblings, but do not necessarily need to be globally unique. "

                "The React lifecycle refers to the various stages that a React component goes through from its birth to its death. The lifecycle stages are mounting, updating, and unmounting. During the mounting stage, a component is created and inserted into the DOM. During the updating stage, a component is updated in response to changes in its props or state. During the unmounting stage, a component is removed from the DOM. Each of these stages has specific methods that can be overridden to add custom functionality to the component, such as componentDidMount() or componentWillUnmount(). "
