  },
  
  {
  id: 13,
  question: "What is the difference between the display and visibility properties in CSS?",
  answer: "The display property determines if an element is shown or hidden, and how it affects the layout of other elements on the page. The visibility property only determines if an element is shown or hidden, but it does not affect the layout of other elements on the page."

},
{
id: 36,
question: "What is the difference between inline and block elements in CSS?",
answer: "Inline elements are elements that do not create line breaks and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples include <span> and <a>. Block elements, on the other hand, create line breaks and take up the full width of their parent element. Examples include <div> and <p>."
},
{
id: 37,
question: "What is the difference between absolute and relative positioning in CSS?",
answer: "Absolute positioning positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (if any), while relative positioning positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow. In other words, absolute positioning takes the element out of the normal document flow, while relative positioning does not."
},
{
id: 38,
question: "What are the different types of positioning in CSS?",
answer: "There are four types of positioning in CSS: static, relative, absolute, and fixed. Static is the default positioning and elements are positioned according to their normal flow in the document. Relative positioning allows elements to be positioned relative to their normal flow position. Absolute positioning positions an element relative to its closest positioned ancestor or to the initial containing block if no positioned ancestor is found. Fixed positioning positions an element relative to the viewport, meaning it will stay in the same place even if the page is scrolled."
},
{
id: 39,
question: "What is a media query in CSS?",
answer: "A media query in CSS is a technique used to apply different styles to different devices or screen sizes based on their characteristics such as width, height, orientation, and resolution. Media queries allow web developers to create responsive designs that adapt to different devices, making websites look good on various screens, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones."
},
{
id: 40,
question: "What is the purpose of the 'clearfix' hack in CSS?",
answer: "The 'clearfix' hack in CSS is used to clear floated elements within a container. When elements are floated, they are taken out of the normal flow of the document, which can cause the container to collapse and not properly contain its floated children. The 'clearfix' hack is used to restore the normal flow of the container and ensure that it expands to the height of its floated children, preventing layout issues."
},
{
id: 41,
question: "What is the purpose of the 'z-index' property in CSS?",
answer: "The 'z-index' property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements on a web page. It determines the order in which elements are stacked along the z-axis, with higher values appearing on top of lower values. 'z-index' is used to create layers and control the visibility and overlap of elements, allowing developers to control the stacking order and layout of elements on a web page."
},
{
id: 42,
question: "What is a pseudo-class in CSS?",
answer: "A pseudo-class in CSS is a keyword added to a selector that targets a specific state or condition of an element. Pseudo-classes are used to apply styles to elements that are in a specific state or condition, such as when a link is hovered over, a checkbox is checked, or an element is the first child of its parent. Pseudo-classes provide a way to select and style elements based on their state or position in the document, without the need for additional markup or JavaScript."
},
{
id: 43,
question: "What is the 'box-sizing' property in CSS?",
answer: "The 'box-sizing' property in CSS is used to control how the total width and height of an element is calculated. It determines whether the width and height of an element should include or exclude the padding, border, and margin. The default value is 'content-box', which means that the width and height only include the content and padding, but not the border or margin. Other values such as 'border-box' include the border and padding in the width and height, making it easier to create elements with fixed sizes and maintain consistent layouts."
},
{
id: 44,
question: "What is the 'nth-child' selector in CSS?",
answer: "The 'nth-child' selector in CSS is used to select and style elements based on their position among their siblings in the parent element. It allows developers to apply styles to specific children elements based on their position, such as the first child, last child, odd or even child, or a specific index. The 'nth-child' selector is a powerful tool for creating dynamic and flexible styles that can adapt to the structure and content of a web page."
},
{
id: 45,
question: "What is a CSS preprocessor?",
answer: "A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends the capabilities of CSS, allowing developers to write more efficient, maintainable, and reusable CSS code. CSS preprocessors provide features such as variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and operators, which are not available in standard CSS. Examples of popular CSS preprocessors include Sass, Less, and Stylus. CSS preprocessors can help improve productivity, reduce code duplication, and make it easier to manage and update CSS styles in large projects."
},
{
id: 46,
question: "What is the purpose of the 'opacity' property in CSS?",
answer: "The 'opacity' property in CSS is used to control the transparency of an element. It determines the level of opacity, or the degree to which an element is transparent, with a value ranging from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque). 'opacity' can be applied to any element, and it affects the entire element and its contents. It is commonly used for creating visual effects, such as fading in/out, overlays, and blending elements with background images or colors."
},
{
id: 47,
question: "What is a CSS pseudo-element?",
answer: "A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that targets a specific part of an element and allows developers to create content or style elements that are not part of the actual HTML markup. Pseudo-elements are used to create decorative elements, such as icons, arrows, and tooltips, or to style specific parts of an element, such as the first letter, first line, or a particular position. Examples of CSS pseudo-elements include ::before, ::after, ::first-letter, and ::first-line."
},
{
id: 48,
question: "What is the difference between 'display: block', 'display: inline', and 'display: inline-block' in CSS?",
answer: "In CSS, 'display: block', 'display: inline', and 'display: inline-block' are used to define how elements should be rendered and positioned on a web page. 'display: block' makes an element a block-level element, which takes up the full width of its parent container and starts on a new line. 'display: inline' makes an element an inline-level element, which only takes up as much width as necessary and does not create a line break. 'display: inline-block' combines the characteristics of both block-level and inline-level elements, allowing an element to have a width and height, but still be positioned inline with other elements. This makes it useful for creating responsive layouts with elements that need to have block-like and inline-like behaviors."
},
{
id: 49,
question: "What is the CSS 'box-shadow' property used for?",
answer: "The 'box-shadow' property in CSS is used to apply a shadow effect to an element. It allows developers to create visual depth by adding shadows behind elements, giving them a three-dimensional appearance. The 'box-shadow' property accepts values for the horizontal and vertical offsets, blur radius, spread distance, and color of the shadow. It can be used to create various types of shadows, such as drop shadows, inner shadows, and multiple shadows, and it is commonly used for adding visual emphasis, highlighting, or depth to elements on a web page."
},
{
id: 50,
question: "What is the 'clearfix' technique in CSS?",
answer: "The 'clearfix' technique in CSS is used to clear floated elements and ensure that their parent element expands to accommodate their height. When elements are floated in CSS, they are taken out of the normal flow of the document, which can cause their parent element to collapse and not properly contain them. The 'clearfix' technique involves adding a CSS class or pseudo-element to the parent element, which clears the float and allows the parent element to properly contain the floated elements. It is commonly used in responsive web design and other scenarios where elements are floated for layout purposes."
